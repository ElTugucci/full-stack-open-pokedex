## CI/CD pipeline for iOS/python SaaS appilication.

We are developing a mobile application with a Python backend and an iOS frontend built with Swift. As we approach the release, setting up a solid Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline is crucial to ensure code quality and catch issues early.

For the Python backend, we use flake8 or pylint for linting, helping maintain coding standards and catch simple errors. pytest is widely used for testing due to its simplicity and flexibility. While Python does not require a traditional build process, tools like setuptools or Docker can package the application for deployment.

On the client iOS side, standart we use SwiftLint for linting. XCTest framework, integrated with Xcode, is used for unit testing, and both building and testing can be automated through the xcodebuild command. Fastlane is often used to simplify tasks like signing and distributing the app.

We decided to set up a CI/CD pipeline using Bitrise. [Bitrise](https://bitrise.io/) is specifically designed for mobile development and provides built-in support for iOS workflows, which makes it a better option than general-purpose CI tools. It also integrates easily with Python backend testing. Setting up Bitrise involves connecting our repository, selecting pre-built workflows, and adding steps to install Python dependencies, run pytest, and build and test the iOS app.

We will use a cloud-based CI setup because it is faster to implement, easy to maintain, and it scales automatically. Bitrise provides cloud macOS machines which are suitable for iOS builds, saving us from managing expensive local infrastructure.
